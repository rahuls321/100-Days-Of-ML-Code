# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code

100 Days Of Machine Learning Code Challenge inspired by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell/100_Days_of_ML_Code)

# Motivation

Machine Learning is the most transformative technology of our time. Whether its helping us discover new drugs for major diseases, fighting fraud, generating music, improving supply chain efficiency, the list of applications are truly endless. In order for us as a community to be able to make valuable contributions to the world, we need to master this technology. This is a call to action, a battle cry, a spark that will light a movement to radically improve the state of humanity. 100 Days of ML Code is a committment to better your understanding of this powerful tool by dedicating at least 1 hour of your time everyday to studying and/or coding machine learning for 100 days.

With This Motivation, I have also started my journey of  [#100DaysOfMLCode](https://twitter.com/search?q=%20%23100DaysOfMLCode&src=typd). 

Let's Begin. 

## Day 1: Data PreProcessing
*  Pre-processing refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to the algorithm.
* Data Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in raw format which is not feasible for the analysis.

 ## Day 2: The Basics: Train the Model
 
The problem we will solve is to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit, where the approximate formula is:

        F=CÃ—1.8+32
         
Of course, it would be simple enough to create a conventional Python function that directly performs this calculation, but that wouldn't be machine learning.

Instead, we will give TensorFlow some sample Celsius values (0, 8, 15, 22, 38) and their corresponding Fahrenheit values (32, 46, 59, 72, 100). Then, we will train a model that figures out the above formula through the training process.
